Crud Application created with laravel(Laravel v8.83.16 (PHP v8.0.19)).

How to open it.
You will need xamp and a code editor for example Visual Studio.
I have my database in localhost/phpmyadmin but you can use whatever you like, just edit .env file. This part:

Open the project with Visual Studio. Open the terminal type: php artisan migrate, after that: php artisan serve.

Insert the http link your browser in my case it is:http://127.0.0.1:8000. It will open laravel welcome page.
Then add /company to the link in my case: http://127.0.0.1:8000/company. Or /employee it depends where you want to start but it really does not mamtter because you can 
navigate through companies and employees.
